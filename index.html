Mike, the owner, has an exceptional level of expertise and attention to detail...Everything is measured perfectly and is 100% level. We had Mike, Matt, David & Jordan install a new chandelier in a 20 foot foyer, 6 new ceiling fans, 10 new can lights, track lighting and hang 3 TV's -  most of which required new wiring as well. Because of their extraordinary skill and precision, our house looks like a model home. When they finish their work, they leave it exactly how they found it... No mess whatsoever. I would recommend Electrical Innovations to anyone that values high quality work, attention to detail and the utmost in integrity and ethical business practices. Truly an exception in the trades!

                    </span> Mike and the guys at Electrical Innovations, LLC are probably some of the easiest and professional companies I've had the pleasure of dealing with. The entire process from start to finish was so smooth. They reached out almost immediately after I put a request in on the pro referral website, Mike promptly came and did an estimate and then 2 days later, his crews were here starting and completing the project, at above and beyond a timely and professional manner. I honestly could not even tell there was any one in the building doing work because they are so efficient and respectful. If any future electrical needs arise, we will definitely be going back with Electrical Innovations and will be the first name given out as a recommendation to any one seeking an electrician. Thank you guys again for your help and making this one less headache of a process. Dont ever change, you guys rock!!
